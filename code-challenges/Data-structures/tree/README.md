# Binary Trees

Trees are basic data structures that have a significant use in computer science. one of its applications is the DOM tree.  
An important aspect of trees is how to traverse them. Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree, and much more! There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

- Depth First
- Breadth First

## Challenge

Create a BinaryTree class
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

## Approach & Efficiency

All the methods should have the time Efficiency of O(n)

## API

Binary Tree methods:

- preOrder
- inOrder
- postOrder
- find-maximum-value
- add

Binary Search tree methods:

- add()
- contain()

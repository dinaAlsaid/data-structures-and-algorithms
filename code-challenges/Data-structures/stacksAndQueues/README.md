# Stacks and Queues

Stacks and queues are basic data structures that have a significant use in computer science. The stack depends on the LIFO/FILO principle and the queue depends on LILO/FIFO principle.

## Challenge

Create classes for both stacks and queues and their methods without using pre-existing methods.

## Approach & Efficiency

All the methods should have tht time effeciency of O(1)

## API

Stack methods:

* Push.
* Pop.
* peek.
* isEmpty.

Queue methods:

* enqueue.
* dequeue.
* peek.
* isEmpty.

# Binary Trees

Trees are basic data structures that have a significant use in computer science. one of its applications is the DOM tree.  
An important aspect of trees is how to traverse them. Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree, and much more! There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

- Depth First
- Breadth First

## Challenge

Create a BinaryTree instance method that finds the maximum value in the tree and returns it

## Approach & Efficiency

The method should have the time Efficiency of O(n)
Space complexity O(n)

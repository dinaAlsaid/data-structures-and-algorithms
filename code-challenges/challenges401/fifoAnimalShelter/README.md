# FIFO animal shelter

A shelter for cats and dogs that operates on FIFO, where a person can adopt a cat or a dog and the cat that first entered the shelter will be adopted first.

## Challenge

Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.

## Approach & Efficiency

create a class that has two queues (using predefined queue class) one for cats and one for dogs then enqueue and dequeue based on the animal type going with the FIFO approach.

Time Efficiency for both methods is O(1) as the queue class
